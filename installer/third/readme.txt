To use Windows Inno setup installer to create an installer, this directory needs to contain:

From http://openssl.org
* libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll
* libssl-1_1-x64.dll
* openssl.exe
* openssl.cnf

From http://nssm.cc
* nssm.exe

And vcredist_x64-vc12.exe (for openssl) and vcredist_x64-vc12.exe (for uniproxy) matching the version of Visual Studio you are using.
