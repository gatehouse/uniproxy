The reasoning being that:

1) For developers: if we receive requests for changing the license to LGPL we will reserve the right to do so.
2) For end users: if there should arise problems from GPL version 3 for example in relation to the SSL keys we will reserve the right to use GPL version 2 instead.

Changing the license to any other license, such as BOOST license or a commercial license will only happen with the consent of all participants.
